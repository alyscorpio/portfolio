                <p>
                    I am a graphic designer, web developer, and multimedia artist besed in New York City and Los Angeles.
                    <br><br>
                    After learning the basics of graphic design in high school, I taught myself how to use Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. 
                    Once I felt proficient enough, I reached out to a local boutique and offered my services as a graphic design intern. The owner 
                    took me on, and during my time there I created promotional material, social media content, and in-store signage. 
                    When it was time for college in 2017, I decided to take a different path, choosing a major in Media, Culture, and the Arts. 
                    This allowed me to take classes in design while also building my knowledge of the media landscape,
                    and art history. 
                    <br><br>
                    Always in persuit of learning something new, I recently enrolled in a coding class at UCLA. So far, I love being able to 
                    create something that is interactive, and designing through a new medium.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not designing or creating web applications, I love to read and write poetry, attend concerts, paint, and cook.
